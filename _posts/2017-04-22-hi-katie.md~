Congrats on being done with France School Stuff. Here's a first draft of your site!

This site is a little techie, so you'll have to use a bit of that CS61A magic to make changes to it.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

This site uses a website generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create the html pages. But it needs a programming language called [ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) and a tool called [bundler](http://bundler.io/) to make things work.

You can install RVM by going [here](https://rvm.io/rvm/install). Or you can just run the following command in your terminal.

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

#### 2. Install bundler.

```
gem install bundler
```

#### 3. Download your website's code

This whole site lives [here, on Github.](https://github.com/katewolffe/katewolffe.github.io). You may have to do a little refresher (or maybe a complete refresher) on git in order to make changes. It'll be frustrating at first, but you'll get it!

Here's a quick course on how to use git (and Github):
[Github's tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### Making changes

Look to the left - There's your face and name. You can change both of those by following the tutorial above to clone [this repository](https://github.com/katewolffe/katewolffe.github.io), make a change, and push.

Here's how you can download the source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/katewolffe/katewolffe.github.io.git
```

Your name lives in a file called `_config.yml`. Open it. You'll see a line with starting with `title:`. Change that line to be whatever you want, it'll appear in the sidebar to the left, then save and exit.

Run your website locally to see what it looks like with your change:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should see:
```
Configuration file: /Users/maxwolffe/Workspace/katewolffe.github.io/_config.yml
Configuration file: /Users/maxwolffe/Workspace/katewolffe.github.io/_config.yml
  Source: /Users/maxwolffe/Workspace/katewolffe.github.io
  Destination: /Users/maxwolffe/Workspace/katewolffe.github.io/_site
  Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
  Generating...
         done in 0.533 seconds.
      Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/maxwolffe/Workspace/katewolffe.github.io'
      Configuration file: /Users/maxwolffe/Workspace/katewolffe.github.io/_config.yml
      Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000//
      Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Go to chrome and enter `http://127.0.0.1:4000` into the address. You should see this site (but with your changes.) It's running on your computer!

If you are happy with it, then "save" it by putting the following two commands into your command line (terminal).

```
git add .
```
Then
```
git commit -am "Changing the title of my website, this is a comment and can be anything."
```

Finally, upload it to Github with this command:

```
git push origin master
```

That's it, give it a shot yourself (you can't break anything), and I'm here for you if you need a hand.

### Writing new posts.

This is a sample blog entry. These all live in the `_posts` directory, and you can add your own! You need to follow the format I've used when naming the file `year-month-day-title.md`. You'll also notice that the formatting is a little strange. It's written using a standard called Markdown. It's actually very simple, and a great skill to learn. Here's a quick tutorial to get you started :).

Once you've written your first post, follow the steps that you did above to commit and push it to Github, and it'll show up alongside this post.

### The Sky is the Limit

This is your site. Let me know what you want to change about it. In case you can't tell, it currently looks a lot like [maxwolffe.com](http://www.maxwolffe.com), which is a great site, and will be changing soon, but isn't YOUR site. Do you want the color to be different? Do you want to use a totally different theme? Do you want a "Contact me" form? Do you want a DISQUS forum so people can comment on your blog posts? Do you want the nav bar to be on the right? I'm here to help you make it yours, let me know what you want different right now, and I'll fix it. When you're back we can sit down and make it EXACTLY what you want together.

Love always,

Max Wolffe
