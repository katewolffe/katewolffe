Hi there!

[Check out my resume here]({{base_url}}public/kate_wolffe_resume.pdf)

I think passion is contagious, and interest is palpable. As a reporter, my curiosity is never satiated.

While writing, I find pleasure in grappling with puzzles — how to communicate a truth in a way that stirs emotions, how to bring attention to subjects that might not initially catch the eye, how to capture someone’s perspective in a fair and nuanced way. My work with the Daily Californian has provided me not only with a platform to share the stories of my Bay Area and UC Berkeley communities, but also taught me lessons about ownership, impact, and teamwork in an occasionally high stress environment.

Using a perspective on human thought and behavior, I am studying Cognitive Science to understand how people of all ages interact with the world around them. I am actively seeking ways to enhance my ability to communicate with and report on individuals and communities. I believe the people of the Bay Area hold more words than I could ever write down, but I guarantee you that my pen is moving just as fast as I can get it to.
